            <h2>Hi. I’m Ryan,</h2>

            <h3>I’ll be your coder for today.</h3>

            <p>
                I’m a motivated software developer with experience across a range of languages and development
                platforms. I’ve written in C++, T-SQL, Javascript, C# and VB.NET [brain damage included].

            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve been lucky enough to work with the biggest names in Australian Game Development and now I’m a Game
                Development contractor and co-founder of Spud Spicer.

            <h2>I'm at my best in small teams.</h2>
            <p>
                I’m first and foremost a team player. I’m at my best when I work in small close-knit teams. I’m very
                passionate about developing solutions that grant others the flexibility to be as creative as possible. I
                derive a lot of satisfaction from knowing that my code empowers my team mates to do the best work that
                they can, every day.

            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <p class="description">
                My skills are built upon a bedrock of C++ Game Development training. I spent several years in an
                enterprise software development role where I learned C# and VB.NET and T-SQL. I returned to video games
                and worked with League of Geeks, Many Monkeys and Mighty Games Group, where I developed my expertise in
                Unity under the titans of the Australian Video Games industry.

            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <p class="description">
                After leaving my enterprise development role, I joined the League of Geeks in their earliest days of
                developing Armello. I transitioned to Many Monkeys where I was privileged to work on the award winning
                game Breath of Light, then moved laterally to Mighty Games where I was involved with Shooty Skies and
                Disney Crossy Road.

            <h3>Software</h3>
            <p class="description">
                I enjoy developing systems that are flexible, open to change, fast and stable. When I can avoid it
                (which is almost always) I’m not the guy that ‘hacks it in’. I always try to balance flexibility and
                modularity with the short term needs of the project. When I touch something for the second time, I want
                the next feature to be clean and easy.
