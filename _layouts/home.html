      <p>
        I’m a motivated software developer with experience across a range of languages and development
        platforms. I’ve written in C++, T-SQL, Javascript, C# and VB.NET [brain damage included].

        I’ve been lucky enough to work with the biggest names in Australian Game Development and now I’m a
        Game Development contractor and co-founder of Spud Spicer.

    <h2>I'm at my best in small&nbsp;teams.</h2>
    <p>
      I’m first and foremost a team player. I’m at my best when I work in small close-knit teams. I’m very
      passionate about developing solutions that grant others the flexibility to be as creative as possible. I
      derive a lot of satisfaction from knowing that my code empowers my team mates to do the best work that
      they can, every day.

      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p>
        My skills are built upon a bedrock of C++ Game Development training. I spent several years in an
        enterprise software development role where I learned C# and VB.NET and T-SQL. I returned to video
        games and worked with League of Geeks, Many Monkeys and Mighty Games Group, where I developed my
        expertise in Unity under the titans of the Australian Video Games industry.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        After leaving my enterprise development role, I joined the League of Geeks in their earliest days of
        developing Armello. I transitioned to Many Monkeys where I was privileged to work on the award
        winning game Breath of Light, then moved laterally to Mighty Games where I was involved with Shooty
        Skies and Disney Crossy Road.

      </div>
      <h3>Software</h3>
      <p>
        I enjoy developing systems that are flexible, open to change, fast and stable. When I can avoid it
        (which is almost always) I’m not the guy that ‘hacks it in’. I always try to balance flexibility and
        modularity with the short term needs of the project. When I touch something for the second time, I
        want the next feature to be clean and easy.
